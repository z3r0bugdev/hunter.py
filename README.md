# GrockPay Scanner Pro  
**Real-time memecoin launch detector on Pump.fun — even if wallets rotate**  
*Powered by Solana, curiosity, and open-source magic. By @z3r0bugdev*

> **"The real treasure is not 42, nor any hidden fund. It’s curiosity and the art of asking the right question."**

---

## What It Does
Scans the **Solana blockchain in real time** and detects:
- New memecoins launched on **Pump.fun**
- **Rotating wallets** (creators changing addresses to avoid detection)
- Basic **rug-pull alerts** (low liquidity after launch)
- Token metadata & transaction details

**No SOL needed**  
**No wallet connection**  
**100% free & open-source**  
**Runs on your PC with Python**
