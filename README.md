Real-time memecoin launch detector on Pump.fun — even if wallets rotate.

Powered by Solana, curiosity, and open-source magic. By [@z3r0bugdev](https://x.com/z3r0bugdev)

> "The real treasure is not 42, nor any hidden fund. It’s curiosity and the art of asking the right question."

## What It Does

- **New memecoins on Pump.fun**: Detects launches via real-time blockchain scanning.
- **Rotating wallets**: Tracks creator address changes to evade detection.
- **Rug-pull alerts**: Flags low liquidity post-launch.
- **Token details**: Fetches metadata, tx signatures, and liquidity checks.
- **No SOL needed**: Runs locally, no wallet connection.
- **100% free & open-source**: Python-based, self-hosted.
